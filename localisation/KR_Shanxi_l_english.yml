#Events
shx.0.t:0 "산서군벌"
shx.0.d:0 "산서군벌은 옌시산이 이끄는 중국의 군벌국 입니다. 그들이 직예군벌에게 영토를 빼앗기고 청나라가 복원됨에 이어, 산서는 예전보다 훨씬 더 고립되어 갔습니다. 산서는 자신의 땅이 침략당하지 않는 한 다른 중국 내의 분쟁에 개입할 의사가 전혀 없습니다. 다만 옌시산과 많은 국민들이 현재 청나라가 점령하고 있는 산서성과 섬서성의 그들의 적법한 영토가 반환되는 것을 보고 싶어 합니다. 옌시산은 기회주의자로 알려져 있으며, 기회가 나타날 경우 그가 놓칠 가능성은 매우 낮습니다."
shx.0.a:0 "중립국은 번영할지어니!"

shx.1.t:0 "염석산주의"
shx.1.d:0 "옌시산은 오랫동안 그의 행정부에 각양각색의 이념과 종교의 많은 부분을 적용해 왔습니다. 염석산주의로 알려진 이 사상은 지금까지는 무시받고 인정받지 못했습니다. 비록 이것이 실제로 성공할지는 미지수이나, 옌시산은 이 상황을 바꾸기를 갈망합니다."
shx.1.a:0 "옌시산은 지혜로운 사람이야."

shx.2.t:0 "옌시산과 펑위샹이 타이위안에서 자금 조달을 위하여 만나다"
shx.2.d:0 "옌시산과 펑위샹은 산시성의 성도에서 열린 주간 회의에서 둘의 수많은 자금 조달을 위한 사업에 대한 논의는 산시의 개선을 염두에 두고 여러 가지 아이디어를 내놓게 만들었습니다. 두 사람은 산시성과 중국 전체가 현대 국가로서 전진하기 위해 서방의 영향력을 필요로 한다는 데 동의했지만, 독일계 광업 업체들의 산시성 침투라는 더 긴급한 문제로 인해 이 문제에 대한 추가 논의는 나중으로 연기해야 한다고 결정했습니다."
shx.2.a:0 "동지들 끼리의 만남이구만!"

shx.3.t:0 "펑위샹은 국민군을 위한 더 많은 투자를 요구합니다"
shx.3.d:0 "펑위샹은 옌시산에게 산시가 살아남기 위해서는 강력한 군사력이 있어야 하며, 그의 국민군이 그 역할을 해야 한다고 제안했습니다. 옌시산은 현재 국민군을 위해서 쓸 수 있는 자금은 없다고 펑위샹에게 이야기했습니다. 펑위샹은 이 답변을 정중하게 받아들였고 토론은 산시의 다른 문제로 넘어갔습니다."
shx.3.a:0 "너무 큰 대가를 지불해야하는군."

shx.4.t:0 "훈훈한 만찬"
shx.4.d:0 "평소 펑위샹과 옌시산의 주간 회담 외에 오늘도 두 사람은 식사를 함께 했습니다. 펑위샹이 중국에 기독교를 전파하려는 그의 노력을 칭찬했던 성공회 선교사인 프랭크 호튼에 대한 호감을 언급하는 등 가벼운 이야기가 오갔습니다. 옌시산은 정중히 그의 말을 듣고 나서 화제를 자신의 사상에 대한  것으로 바꾸었습니다. 그들의 회담은 밤이 깊도록 계속되었고, 둘 다 서로의 계획을 조금 더 잘 이해했으며 회담은 종결되었습니다."
shx.4.a:0 "모두가 즐거웠던 밤이었어!"

shx.5.t:0 "펑위샹은 옌시산의 권한을 무시하고 국민군을 위해 여분의 돈을 확보한다"
shx.5.d:0 "충격적이게도 펑위샹은 그의 국민군을 위한 추가 자금을 확보했습니다. 많은 사람들이 그가 산시성을 괴롭히고 있다고 말하는 것은 선교사들과의 새로운 연줄을 통해서라고 인식되고 있지만, 그것이 옌시산에게 알려지지는 않았습니다. 펑위샹이 다른 속셈을 지니고 있을지도 모르지만, 그는 펑위샹이 궁극적으로 산시의 이익을 위해 일하고 있다고 결론짓고 이 상황을 단순히 받아들이기로 했으며 현재 걱정할 것은 거의 없다고 얘기했습니다."
shx.5.a:0 "이야기를 조금 해봐야겠어"

shx.6.t:0 "옌시산이 경제 회의를 개최하다"
shx.6.d:0 "옌시산이 개최한 회의에서 검은 월요일 사건이 산시성 경제에 미치는 영향을 중심으로 논의가 이뤄졌습니다. 지금까지 독일발 공황의 영향은 산시성의 미약한 경제 때문에 크지 않았습니다.\n\n세계와 산시성 경제의 단절에도 불구하고 옌시산은 투자 방향을 농업 부문으로 돌렸습니다."
shx.6.a:0 "우리 경제에 집중하자고."

shx.7.t:0 "펑위샹이 신병 모집을 위해 위린으로 가다"
shx.7.d:0 "펑위샹은 그의 군대와 선교사들과 함께 위린을 여행하면서 친선 방문이라고 불리는 것을 시작했습니다. 오랫동안 그는 기독교식 세례를 받고자 하는 사람은 누구든지 국민군에 모집하여 자신의 사상을 계속 전파해 왔고 이 활동은 지역에 약간의 안정을 가져다 주었습니다. 다만 그것의 주된 목표는 군내 펑의 권력 기반을 강화하는 것으로 보이기 때문에 지역 안정의 효과는 일시적일 것입니다..."
shx.7.a:0 "우리 군대는 충분히 크지 않나?"

shx.8.t:0 "옌시산이 펑위샹에게 군에 대하여 말하다"
shx.8.d:0 "옌시산은 펑위샹의 정치적 야망을 우려하여 그와 개인적으로 면담을 했습니다. 두 사람은 옌시산이 국민군은 펑위샹 뿐 아니라 자신에게도 충성을 맹세해야 한다고 주장하자 이에 대한 격론을 벌였습니다. 펑위샹은 한발 물러서서 국민군은 옌시산과 산서성에 충성한다고 변명했습니다."
shx.8.a:0 "우정에 균열이 생기는건 흔한 일이다."

shx.9.t:0 "옌시산이 농업의 현대화를 계획하다"
shx.9.d:0 "옌시산은 유럽인 고문들과 모여서 산서성 농업 부문의 현대화에 대한 계획을 세웠습니다. 그는 이 계획이 자급자족을 가능케하고 농민들의 생활을 개선시키기를 바랍니다."
shx.9.a:0 "바쁘다 바뻐."

shx.10.t:0 "펑위샹이 정부 관계자들과 만나다"
shx.10.d:0 "펑위샹이 최근 타이위안의 지방 공무원들과 만난 것으로 추정됩니다. 그는 자신의 급진적인 생각을 알리고 지지자를 모으려고 노력한 것으로 보입니다. 대부분은 그를 무시했지만, 일부는 그의 말에 감화된 것 같습니다."
shx.10.a:0 "군사 문제나 신경쓰라고."

shx.11.t:0 "독일 소유 광산 업체가 산시 동부로 들어서다"
shx.11.d:0 "동부 산시(진시) 지역에 팔성연합의 대리인을 통해 운영되는 독일 소유의 광산 회사가 진출하기 시작했습니다. 탄광 인근에 위치한 마을 주민들은 갱도 공사 및 채굴로 인한 환경 피해 때문에 이주할 수밖에 없었다고 말했습니다."
shx.11.a:0 "그들이 가져가는 자원들은 우리 것인데!"

shx.12.t:0 "독일의 착취로 농민들이 격분하다"
shx.12.d:0 "독일 광산업체들의 극도로 파괴적인 방법은 지역 농민들과 충돌을 일으켰습니다. 지금까지 시위는 경미했지만 긴장이 고조되면 자원의 유통을 방해할 수 있다는 우려가 생깁니다."
shx.12.a:0 "젠장."

shx.13.t:0 "북서부 산시 농민들이 독일의 침략에 항거하다"
shx.13.d:0 "독일 기업들은 채광 작업을 북서부 산시성으로 확장하려고 시도했으며 예상대로 큰 반대에 부딫히게 되었으며 민심은 악화되었습니다. 비교적 온건했던 남쪽과는 달리, 북부 지역의 저항은 더욱 커져만 갔으며 이는 독일 기업들이 한 일을 중지시킬 수 있었습니다. 농민들은 정부와 옌시산은 개입하지 않고 무엇을 했냐고 비난하였으며 성난 폭도들이 모습을 들어냈습니다..."
shx.13.a:0 "진압군을 조직해야 하나..."

shx.14.t:0 "펑위샹은 산시 서부의 저항을 처리하고 싶어한다"
shx.14.d:0 "Civil disorder continues amongst peasants in the western districts of Shanxi due to the recent expansion of League of Eight Provinces-backed companies (who are ultimately backed by the Germans). Feng has announced that he and his cohorts will quell the protests and will do so without the need for bloodshed. Those within Yan's inner circle have cautioned him that this is a ploy by Feng to garner further support, and they recommend sending someone more trustworthy to deal with the disorder."
shx.14.a:0 "그에게 행운을 빈다."
shx.14.b:0 "아니, 우 중장을 대신 보내라."

shx.15.t:0 "펑위샹의 서북부 산시 작전"
shx.15.d:0 "Tensions were high when Feng and his soldiers arrived. Feng conferred with his officers and his priest, and decided to open a dialogue with the miners. After a many long, tense hours of negotiations, the miners agreed to end their protest after securing concessions from Feng. He promised to address their grievances and secure improved working conditions, as well as some other details that were not made public. Before he left, Feng lead an open prayer service with some of the peasants even joining in."
shx.15.a:0 "그의 기독교가 외교적 성공으로 이어진건가?"

shx.16.t:0 "산시성의 아편 거래"
shx.16.d:0 "Opium, the scourge of China, is been traded and smuggled though Shanxi. Extreme measures have been enacted to ensure that those caught abusing this wretched substance are punished, with no exceptions given, neither for title nor rank. All opium smugglers will find the warm embrace of the hangman's noose."
shx.16.a:0 "젠장할."

shx.17.t:0 "현대화 자금 조달"
shx.17.d:0 "The modernisation of Shanxi will be a very expensive endeavour, and there are few options available to the government. After intense debate amongst those close to him, Yan has been presented three options:"
shx.17.a:0 "자선 모금!"
shx.17.b:0 "세금 인상!"
shx.17.c:0 "군비 축소!"

shx.18.t:0 "현대화가 시작될 예정입니다!"
shx.18.d:0 "After much toil and hardship, Shanxi is financially prepared to take its first step towards modernising the state."
shx.18.a:0 "드디어!"

shx.19.t:0 "산시의 부패"
shx.19.d:0 "Widespread corruption is beginning to rear its ugly head within Shanxi. Reports of people from all levels of government accepting bribes or being linked to the spread of opium are arriving with unsettling frequency. This must cease if Shanxi is to truly prosper."
shx.19.a:0 "그들은 처리될 것이다."

shx.20.t:0 "부패 공무원이 척결되다"
shx.20.d:0 "After thorough investigation and interrogation, several members of the government have been found guilty of corruption. The punishments for these crimes range from harsh fines to incarceration for the more extreme cases."
shx.20.a:0 "정의가 승리했다."

shx.21.t:0 "청위샹이 만찬을 주최하다"
shx.21.d:0 "Feng has hosted a dinner and seems to have invited everyone except Yan. Word has reached Yan that during the festivities, Feng was discussing the future of Shanxi, and there was also much discussion about Christianity."
shx.21.a:0 "내 초대장은 우편함에서 분실된건가..."

shx.22.t:0 "독일 광산 업체의 제안"
shx.22.d:0 "A German mining company has approached us with a proposal that we assist them in their operations within Shanxi. They have offered Yan 30% of the profits from the mines. This move would be highly unpopular with the peasants, but it would benefit our economy."
shx.22.a:0 "거래 하자고."
shx.22.b:0 "거절한다."

shx.23.t:0 "서부 산시의 독일 광산 회사에 대한 격분"
shx.23.d:0 "Western Shanxi is becoming engulfed in civil strife as German mining companies have continued their relentless expansion in the area. Some in the government had predicted this outcome, as it was impossible to conceal the fact that Yan Xishan has allowed these operations to continue.\nIt appears the only political persona to benefit from these events is Feng Yuxiang, as the local peasants have aligned themselves with his ideology after denouncing Yan for allowing foreign companies to exploit Shanxi's resources."
shx.23.a:0 "이런 젠장."

shx.24.t:0 "펑위샹이 독일 광산 업체들을 비판하다"
shx.24.d:0 "In statements echoing the anti-concessionist rhetoric heard elsewhere in China, Feng Yuxiang has delivered a passionate speech denouncing the foreign mining companies operating in Shanxi. More and more people are attending his rallies and popular support for his ideology is on the rise."
shx.24.a:0 "이것이 우리와 독일의 관계를 악화시킬거야."

shx.25.t:0 "아편굴 급습"
shx.25.d:0 "During a recent opium den raid, several officers loyal to Yan have been caught red-handed with the vile drug, with one being Lt. Wu, a well-entrenched officer within Yan's government. As the news reached Yan, some of his advisors have suggested that the officers and officials who were arrested in the raid be given a lighter sentence, in light of their rank and position."
shx.25.a:0 "누구도 법 위에 있지 않지"
shx.25.b:0 "가택 연금 정도면 충분해..."

shx.26.t:0 "우 장군에 대한 논란이 확산되다"
shx.26.d:0 "The news that Yan Xishan has only given Lt. Wu and several other officers sentences of house arrest, as opposed to prison time or even hard labour, has swept across Shanxi like wildfire. Feng has taken the opportunity both to denounce the use of opium as a tool of the Devil to pacify the Chinese, and to condemn Wu and his fellow officers for their use of the drug. One thing is certain, public support for Feng is increasing more and more, while the opinion of Yan and his leadership of Shanxi is at an all-time low."
shx.26.a:0 "아, 우 개같은 놈"

shx.27.t:0 "펑위샹이 산간벽지에 물자를 지원하다"
shx.27.d:0 "Feng and his numerous missionaries have visited many of the poorer villages in Shanxi to give them much-needed aid. These visits have increased Feng's popularity in the rural areas, with many peasants saying they consider him to be the spiritual leader of Shanxi, rather than Yan. Furthermore, he has established several new churches, and Christianity has spread considerably.\nYan's advisors have strongly suggested that such excursions be stopped, as it is clear that Feng is manipulating the peasants in order to increase his popularity. Perhaps Feng's missionaries should be escorted by trustworthy government bodyguards, for their own protection of course. While in all likelihood, few people would believe this, and our move to tighten the leash on Feng would be evident to all, it would undoubtedly hinder Feng's political machinations."
shx.27.a:0 "우리는 그가 대중을 세뇌시키는 것을 막아야 한다."
shx.27.b:0 "원하면 해야지."

shx.28.t:0 "펑위샹이 위린 시장과 만나다"
shx.28.d:0 "Feng, during his travels, has met with the Governor of Yulin. Thanks to his previous Good Will Tour, Feng is an extremely popular character in Yulin. Worryingly, details of the discussion between Feng and the governor have not yet reached Yan Xishan and his trusted ministers. This suggests that Feng and his Guominjun have been able to increase their internal security and thwart our attempts to spy on their activities."
shx.28.a:0 "망할놈의 정치공작."

shx.29.t:0 "Yang Hucheng Discusses Military Policy"
shx.29.d:0 "Yang Hucheng has proposed some changes to Shanxi's military policy. His proposed alterations, though small, would put Shanxi on a more aggressive footing. Feng Yuxiang has supported this change, stating that Shanxi should not remain passive as the myriad turmoils of China continue to unfold around us."
shx.29.a:0 "Keep it the same."
shx.29.b:0 "Increase it."

shx.31.t:0 "Shanxi Moves Troops into Gansu"
shx.31.d:0 "With all our troops on the frontlines, our local garrisons and peacekeeping forces have been severely depleted. Fighting desperately to reverse our numerous military defeats at the hands of the foreigners, we have been unable to maintain public order in our territories. In the meantime, troops from our neighbors in the Shanxi Clique have crossed the border into Lanzhou, ostensibly to safeguard the population against banditry or reprisals by foreign troops. As our military cohesion is tenuous, we can ill afford to risk opening yet another front against Shanxi."
shx.31.a:0 "We cannot afford another war."
shx.31.b:0 "Resist those traitors!"

shx.32.t:0 "The Mas Surrender"
shx.32.d:0 "Our troops have swiftly and efficiently occupied Lanzhou, with the few remaining local garrison troops yielding peacefully to our forces. It seems that, given their current situation, the Ma leadership has chosen to allow our occupation to proceed."
shx.32.a:0 "Excellent!"

shx.33.t:0 "The Mas Resist"
shx.33.d:0 "The local garrisons and remaining reserves in Lanzhou have resisted our incursion into Gansu province, and we have received a defiant message from the Ma leadership: they demand that we remove our troops from the region immediately, or else it will be seen as an act of war. It seems that our hopes of a peaceful occupation have been dashed, and despite their precarious military position, the Ma clan is prepared to fight us in order to defend their territory."
shx.33.a:0 "We are already committed, war it shall be!"
shx.33.a:0 "Back down, we cannot afford this war."

shx.50.t:0 "Miners Put Down"
shx.50.d:0 "In an unfortunate turn of events, the forces under Lieutenant Wu were unable to resolve the conflict peacefully, and had to use force to suppress the riots. Feng has responded with a fiery speech denouncing what he calls the "Jinxi Massacre". "Such conduct by military officers is unacceptable," Feng claims, "for these men were sent to protect these people, not slaughter them." Feng's speech has rallied miners and laborers across the province, and he has promised that those officers responsible for the massacre will be held accountable for their actions."
shx.50.a:0 "What is he up to?"

shx.60.t:0 "Feng's Popularity on the Rise within the Military"
shx.60.d:0 "Feng's popularity within the military is becoming worrisome for those who are aligned with Yan. Some fear that if this continues to happen then Feng will have complete loyalty of the military and may ask his dear friend Yan to "step aside". Only time will tell..."
shx.60.a:0 "Disturbing..."

shx.61.t:0 "Feng's Popularity on the Rise within Shanxi"
shx.61.d:0 "Feng's recent political programs and initiatives have begun to bear fruit, with numerous groups from peasants to official magistrates beginning to show their support for Feng. If this trend continues, Feng will secure control of the government, effectively removing his dear friend Yan from his position."
shx.61.a:0 "Distressing..."

shx.63.t:0 "Feng's Bloodless Coup"
shx.63.d:0 "Feng has secured the support of both the government and the military, and has taken control of Shanxi in a bloodless coup. Yan Xishan has decided to gracefully step aside, given that he considers Feng's vision for the future of Shanxi as sufficiently similar to his own (despite Feng's zealous Christianity). Feng has allowed Yan to remain in an advisory post, as Yan's insights may well be required in the challenges that are sure to come in the future.\n\n Christian missionaries are holding special services, with hundreds coming forth to be baptised across Shanxi, further cementing Feng's Christian powerbase among the population of Shanxi. In one peculiar incident, due to the high volumes of those seeking to be baptised, Feng – ever the pragmatist – suggested using a fire hose to "Baptise the Masses". This was frowned upon by his missionaries, although it did have its desired effect. Time will tell how Feng, his Christianity, and his "Pragmatism" will continue to shape Shanxi and even China as a whole."
shx.63.a:0 "Pragmatic indeed..."

shx.64.t:0 "Feng Yuxiang Desires an Alliance"
shx.64.d:0 "Feng Yuxiang, the leader of the Guominjun in Shanxi, has approached us with a request for a formal military alliance. While he could be a very useful ally, he is also extremely zealous in his spiritual pursuits and may hold ulterior ambitions for the future of China."
shx.64.a:0 "We shall accept."
shx.64.b:0 "Feng cannot be trusted."

shx.65.t.accept:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Alliance"
shx.65.d.accept:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted an alliance with Feng."
shx.65.a:0 "Excellent."

shx.65.t.refuse:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Alliance"
shx.65.d.refuse:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused an alliance with Feng."
shx.65.b:0 "Their loss."

shx.300.t:0 "The Question of Workers' Rights"
shx.300.d:0 "There are two schools of thought in Shanxi about workers' rights: The first is allowing bureaucrats to introduce reforms that will more or less favour employers and businesses in Shanxi. The second is ensuring that workers' rights are protected, despite the disadvantages this presents to business owners and foreign investors."
shx.300.a:0 "The bureaucrats will introduce reforms. Foreign capital is a must."
shx.300.b:0 "Ensure that all citizens in Shanxi are protected. The foreigners must abide by our laws."

shx.301.t:0 "The Question of Landowners"
shx.301.d:0 "China is a nation in which, like many nations in the west, a few individuals own vast swaths of land, with indentured peasants working the land. New reforms could abolish these practices, with land reforms allowing the peasants to become owners of their own lands, the former landowners being forced to sell these lands to the government. \n\nAnother option is to compromise with the landowners, setting caps on their taxation of peasants, which could eventually lead to the peasants being able to afford their freedom. This option is favoured by Yan's advisors, as it would allow gradual change as opposed to radical land reforms."
shx.301.a:0 "China will reform gradually, we must compromise with landowners."
shx.301.b:0 "We require radical land reforms, force the landowners to sell."

shx.302.t:0 "토지 개혁의 성공"
shx.302.d:0 "Our efforts at land reform are beginning to pay serious dividents. Opium fields have been eradicated, and production of food crops has increased. Furthermore, now that some farmers are starting to own their own land, there are serious incentives to increasing efficiency, and new techniques to improve yields and reduce soil erosion are being implemented."
shx.302.a:0 "좋은 소식이다!"

shx.401.t:0 "Shanxi Petitions Germany for Weapons"
shx.401.d:0 "Our diplomats have prepared a formal request for German aid in the form of arms shipments. If they accept, they will demonstrate that they are committed to sensible government and good relations in China."
shx.401.a:0 "Further assistance for our cause."

shx.402.t:0 "산시가 무기를 요청하다"
shx.402.d:0 "Shanxi, a small warlord state in China, has petitioned us for arms."
shx.402.a:0 "소총을 좀 보내줘라."
shx.402.b:0 "산시에 관심이 가지 않는군."

shx.403.t:0 "독일이 승낙하다!"
shx.403.d:0 "The Germans have granted our request for armaments, and the shipments are already underway."
shx.403.a:0 "그들의 도움으로, 우리는 스스로를 지킬 수 있게되었다."

shx.404.t:0 "The Germans Deny Our Request!"
shx.404.d:0 "The Germans have refused our request for arms. This is a dark day for Sino-German relations."
shx.404.a:0 "No matter, we shall stand on our own."

shx.405.t:0 "Shanxi Petitions Russia for Weapons"
shx.405.d:0 "Our diplomats have prepared a formal request for Russian aid in the form of arms shipments. If they accept, they will demonstrate that they are committed to sensible government and good relations in China."
shx.405.a:0 "Further assistance for our cause."

shx.406.t:0 "Shanxi Requests Weapons"
shx.406.d:0 "Shanxi, a small warlord state in China, has petitioned us for arms."
shx.406.a:0 "Let's give them some rifles."

###Reuse in new Feng tree
#"The Guominjun was founded out of desperation. When popular liberation had so nearly been secured, its leaders were betrayed. Finding sanctuary in Shanxi, they have grown stronger and the people have now become desperate. With enthusiasm the people have brought the men of the Guominjun to power. Here we shall build a land like no other, where no man shall hunger in body or soul."
#"God so loved humanity that He sent His only Son to die for us. Yet almost two millennia later so many in China know not of The Son or his message of progress. Through sweeping principled education reform perhaps that can be addressed."
#"Heaven rewards those who work hard. Indeed, it was a particular cultural affinity for this religious value which allowed the west, and particularly protestant nations, to develop rapidly. We must promote such an ethos."
#"Shanxi has always been under threat, and with the radical ideas of the Guominjun now being implemented, the danger of conquest has increased further. The entire state bureaucracy must be reorganized and physically relocated to operate from defensible positions."
#"With their expulsion from Gansu, the Guominjun's organisational structures were fractured. With control of Shanxi, we should begin to reconstruct the Guominjin itself, separate from, but intimately intertwined with the apparatus of the state."
#"Beyond agriculture, cottage industries dominate the economy of Shanxi. Perhaps with state provision of certain traditional sectors and incentivization, some may truly embrace industry of the modern kind from their own homes. As The Lord was a carpenter, artisans and craftsmen the masses shall be."
#"The production of sufficient small arms to suit the needs of not only the army but the masses as well is essential for our defense. We must encourage new cottage industrialists to take up gunsmithing in particular."
#"We have transformed the foundations of society and we must now make clear in ideological terms the necessity of the coming struggle. The final fate of Shanxi, and all China, hangs in the balance."
